#Rules 


The following attemps to document the rules that apply to the various parts of a Tweet. It is based purely on observation; as of now

A hashtag is a string of characters beginning with a '#' character followed by one or more alphanumeric characters. It must contain at least one letter. A hashtag may not contain another hash character aside from the initial character.
